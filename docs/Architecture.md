# Architecture

The `googledrive-new` repository demonstrates a Maven-based Java project with standard application structure and integrations for CI/CD workflows and security scanning tools.

## Components

### 1. **Java Application Source**
   - Located under the `java-hello-world-with-maven-master/src` directory.
   - Organized in a standard Maven directory structure: `src/main/java`.
   - **Key files**:
     - `hello/Greeter.java`: A class providing functionality to generate greetings.
     - `hello/HelloWorld.java`: Entry point for the application.

### 2. **Build Configuration with Maven**
   - Maven ensures dependency management and build processes with the `pom.xml` file.
   - Includes plugins for compilation, testing, and packaging.

### 3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - **GitHub Actions**:
     - `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` defines a CodeQL static analysis workflow.
   - **Jenkins**:
     - `Jenkinsfile` defines Jenkins pipeline steps for building, testing, and deploying the application.

### 4. **Security Integrations**
   - `.whitesource`: Contains configurations for security and compliance scanning via WhiteSource.

This architecture is modular, scalable, and aligned with standard development practices to support integration, deployment, and security workflows.
